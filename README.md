run DAO/inter_test/train_DAO.py

The MASS dataset can be download at:https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/9MYUCS
The SLEEP_EDF dataset can be download at:https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/
All the data should be processed as .npy format.

In this code, we have released 50disa_model.pth in DAO/DISA/save_model/ for DAO perform ETF joint optimization.
